# JPA Relationships mapping

The classes in OOP, to entities in JPA are treated as relational tables in a DBMS. That's why, the relationships between entities should be translated as attributes in tables. 
There are four types of association mappings :
<ul>
<li>One To One </li>
<li>One To Many </li>
<li>Many To One </li>
<li>Many To Many </li>
</ul>
<i>The Many to Many relationship will be treated alone in a whole repository</i>

<h2> One To One mapping </h2>

![One_To_One]

<h2> One To Many mapping </h2>

![One_To_Many]

<h2> Many To One mapping </h2>

![Many_To_One]
